<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


There are many great api built with Spring boot and/or Angular available on GitHub. however, we would likje to purpose a different approach and connect 3 applications with a modern front-end design.

Here's the project:
* The back-end developed with Spring boot / Maven / hibernate. Connected to Binance and also our front-end api. 
* The front-end developed with Angular / Material / Bootstrap. Also connected to Binance and with our back-end api.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To develop this project, I've used IntelliJ for the back and Webstorm for the front. You can easilly use other IDE but it's a good idea to use 2 programs to run and test the api in real time.

### Front Prerequisites

As usual, don't forget to install Node.js. Then, you need to install Angular
* npm
```sh
npm install @angular/cli
```

ANgular Material
* npm
```sh
ng add @angular/material
```

Flex-layout
* npm
```sh
npm install @angular/flex-layout --save
```



### Front Prerequisites simplified install

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/GregSino/RentCarFront.git
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
